This project is part of a Data Analysis with Python [training course on Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/@NechuBM/playlists), I used the code (fully commented) to develop the examples and solve problems exposed during the program. 

It is a good practice to practice Python and some basic probability concepts useful for Data Science.
